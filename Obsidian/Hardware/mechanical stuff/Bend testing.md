###### *(also referred to as flexure testing or transverse beam testing)*
### Definition
It is a form of destructive testing to ascertain the strength and ductility of a certain material. in this test, the material is subjected to bending forces until it reaches the point of fracture.

### Standards and specifications
- **ISO (International Organization for Standardization)**
	- **ISO 7438**: Metallic materials - Bend test. ([[ISO 7438.pdf]])
	- **ISO 178**: Plastics - Determination of flexural properties.

### Modes of operation
- Automatically
	- Using the motor encoder we get the distance, we measure the force with the sensors
	- 0-25mm distance, we'll get the force
- Manually
	- Setpoint in mm
