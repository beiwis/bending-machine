### Status
The script that worked was a mess so I re-did it to make it more robust and reliable
### What I've done
I've created a whole new script practically from scratch because the other one was a mess
### Next objectives
- test it on the raspberry
- write the requirements.txt file
- delete the rest of files and tidy them up a little bit
