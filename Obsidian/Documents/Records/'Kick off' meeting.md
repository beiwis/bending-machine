### Status
The motor works (using the manual function), but not the automatic function.
### What we did
I showed Samih around GitHub, he walked me through the workings of the machine and explained to me what the code is supposed to do.
### Next objectives
We have decided that I (Bea) am going to debug the code (that I uploaded to GitHub) and clean it up a little for next monday, while Samih will update the probant and document a little bit the project.
